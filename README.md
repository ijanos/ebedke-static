# Eb√©dke

Static site generator, successor for
[ebedke](https://github.com/ijanos/ebedke).

The original project did site crawling. This project is a really basic, custom
static site generator. It lists the restaurants the original project used to
crawl. I'm shutting down the original's backend server so I needed something
static I can put on the website.

Run `build.sh` and the static site will be generated in the `build` directory.
This repo can be used to feed a [Cloudfare
Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) deployment.
